# Emergency Procedures

This section covers procedures for handling inflight emergencies.

*   **Lost Link:** The loss of the command and control link. The sUAS should follow a pre-programmed procedure, such as returning to the home point.
*   **Flyaway:** The sUAS does not respond to commands. The remote PIC should try to regain control, and if unsuccessful, notify ATC and other aircraft in the area.
*   **Battery Failure:** A critical emergency that can result in a loss of control. The remote PIC should land the aircraft as soon as possible.
