# Aircraft Performance

Aircraft performance is affected by a variety of factors.

### Factors Affecting Performance:

*   **Weight:** A heavier aircraft will have reduced performance.
*   **Density Altitude:** A high density altitude will reduce performance.
*   **Wind:** A headwind will reduce takeoff distance and increase climb angle. A tailwind will have the opposite effect.
*   **Center of Gravity:** An out-of-limit CG will reduce performance and can make the aircraft uncontrollable.

### Performance Charts

*   Aircraft manufacturers provide performance charts that can be used to determine the aircraft's performance under various conditions.
*   You must be able to read and interpret these charts to ensure safe operation.
