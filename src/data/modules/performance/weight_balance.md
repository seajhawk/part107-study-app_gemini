# Weight and Balance

Weight and balance are critical to the safety of flight.

### Weight

*   **Maximum Gross Takeoff Weight:** The maximum allowable weight of the aircraft at takeoff, as determined by the manufacturer.
*   **Overloading:** Exceeding the maximum gross takeoff weight can have serious consequences, including reduced climb performance, longer takeoff distance, and structural damage.

### Balance

*   **Center of Gravity (CG):** The point at which the aircraft would balance if it were suspended. The CG must be within the limits specified by the manufacturer.
*   **Forward CG:** A CG that is too far forward can make the aircraft difficult to rotate for takeoff and can increase the stall speed.
*   **Aft CG:** A CG that is too far aft can make the aircraft unstable and difficult to control.
