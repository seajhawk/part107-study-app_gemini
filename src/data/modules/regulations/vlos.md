# Visual Line of Sight (VLOS) and Visual Observers

The sUAS must be operated within the visual line of sight of the remote pilot or a designated visual observer.

### VLOS

*   The remote PIC and the person manipulating the flight controls must be able to see the sUAS with vision unaided by any device other than corrective lenses.

### Visual Observer (VO)

*   A VO may be used to assist the remote PIC in maintaining VLOS and seeing and avoiding other aircraft.
*   The remote PIC must ensure that the VO is co-located with the remote PIC and that there is effective communication between them at all times.
