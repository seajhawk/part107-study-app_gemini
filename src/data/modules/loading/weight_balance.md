# Weight and Balance

This section covers the principles of weight and balance.

*   **Weight:** The force of gravity on an object.
*   **Balance:** The location of the center of gravity (CG) of the aircraft.
*   **Center of Gravity (CG):** The point at which the aircraft would balance if it were suspended. The CG must be within the limits specified by the manufacturer.
*   **Effects of Overloading:** Overloading can have serious consequences, including reduced performance, longer takeoff distance, and structural damage.
*   **Load Factor:** The ratio of the total air load acting on the aircraft to the gross weight of the aircraft. The load factor increases during maneuvers.
