# Airspace Authorization

To operate a drone in controlled airspace (Class B, C, D, or E), you must obtain airspace authorization from the FAA.

### LAANC

*   **Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability (LAANC):** LAANC is a system that automates the process of obtaining airspace authorization. It is available at many airports throughout the country.
*   You can access LAANC through one of the FAA-approved LAANC UAS Service Suppliers.

### Manual Authorization

*   If LAANC is not available at the airport where you want to fly, you can submit a request for airspace authorization through the [FAADroneZone](https://faadronezone.faa.gov/) website.
*   Manual authorizations can take up to 90 days to process.
