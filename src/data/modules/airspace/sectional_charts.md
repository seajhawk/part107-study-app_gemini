# Reading Sectional Charts

Sectional charts are the primary navigational reference for VFR pilots. Drone pilots must be able to read and interpret these charts to identify airspace, obstacles, and other important information.

### Key things to look for:

*   **Airspace:** Identify the class of airspace you will be operating in.
*   **Obstacles:** Towers, buildings, and other obstructions are depicted on the chart with their height in both MSL and AGL.
*   **Airports:** Airports are depicted with their name, elevation, and other information.
*   **Terrain:** Contour lines depict the elevation of the terrain.
*   **Special Use Airspace:** MOAs, Restricted Areas, etc., are clearly marked.

*This is a complex topic that requires visual aids. We will add images and videos to this module later.*
