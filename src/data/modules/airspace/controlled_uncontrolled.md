# Controlled and Uncontrolled Airspace

Understanding the different classes of airspace is crucial for safe drone operation.

### Uncontrolled Airspace

*   **Class G Airspace:** Extends from the surface to the base of the overlying Class E airspace. No air traffic control (ATC) services are provided. Most drone operations occur in Class G airspace.

### Controlled Airspace

*   **Class E Airspace:** Generally begins at 700 or 1,200 feet AGL and extends up to but not including 18,000 feet MSL. Some Class E airspace begins at the surface. Requires ATC authorization to operate in.
*   **Class D Airspace:** Extends from the surface to 2,500 feet AGL, surrounding airports with an operational control tower. Requires ATC authorization.
*   **Class C Airspace:** Extends from the surface to 4,000 feet AGL, surrounding busy airports. Consists of two rings, a 5 NM inner ring and a 10 NM outer ring. Requires ATC authorization.
*   **Class B Airspace:** Extends from the surface to 10,000 feet MSL, surrounding the nation's busiest airports. Resembles an upside-down wedding cake. Requires ATC authorization.
*   **Class A Airspace:** Extends from 18,000 feet MSL up to and including FL600 (approximately 60,000 feet). All operations in Class A airspace must be conducted under IFR. Drone operations are not permitted in Class A airspace.
