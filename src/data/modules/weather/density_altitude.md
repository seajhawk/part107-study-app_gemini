# Density Altitude

Density altitude is the pressure altitude corrected for non-standard temperature.

### Factors Affecting Density Altitude:

*   **High Altitude:** The higher the altitude, the higher the density altitude.
*   **High Temperature:** The higher the temperature, the higher the density altitude.
*   **High Humidity:** The higher the humidity, the higher the density altitude.

### Effects on Performance:

*   A high density altitude will significantly reduce the performance of your drone, including reducing lift, climb rate, and engine performance.
