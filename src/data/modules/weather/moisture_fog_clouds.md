# Moisture, Fog, and Clouds

Moisture in the atmosphere is the source of all clouds and precipitation.

### Moisture

*   **Dew Point:** The temperature at which the air must be cooled to become saturated.
*   **Relative Humidity:** The amount of moisture in the air compared to the maximum amount of moisture the air can hold at that temperature.

### Fog

*   **Fog:** A cloud that is on or near the ground. There are several types of fog, including radiation fog, advection fog, and upslope fog.

### Clouds

*   **Clouds:** Visible aggregations of minute water droplets and/or ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere. Clouds are classified by their height and appearance.
