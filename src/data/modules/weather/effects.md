# Effects of Weather on Performance

This section covers how weather affects sUAS performance.

*   **Density Altitude:** The primary factor in aircraft performance. High density altitude reduces performance.
*   **Wind:** Can affect takeoff, landing, and in-flight stability.
*   **Temperature:** High temperatures reduce performance.
*   **Humidity:** High humidity reduces performance.
*   **Thunderstorms:** A major hazard to all aircraft.
*   **Icing:** Can disrupt airflow and add weight to the aircraft.
