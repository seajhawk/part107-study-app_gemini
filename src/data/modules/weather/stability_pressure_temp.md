# Atmospheric Stability, Pressure, and Temperature

Understanding these concepts is key to predicting weather.

### Atmospheric Stability

*   **Stability:** The atmosphere's resistance to vertical motion. A stable atmosphere will resist vertical motion, while an unstable atmosphere will encourage it.
*   **Lapse Rate:** The rate at which temperature decreases with an increase in altitude. The standard lapse rate is 2Â°C per 1,000 feet.

### Pressure

*   **High Pressure:** Associated with good weather.
*   **Low Pressure:** Associated with bad weather.

### Temperature

*   **Temperature Inversion:** A layer of warm air over a layer of cold air. This can trap pollutants and create a layer of haze or fog.
