# METARs and TAFs

METARs and TAFs are two of the most common types of aviation weather reports.

### METAR

*   **Aviation Routine Weather Report (METAR):** A report of current weather conditions at an airport. They are typically issued every hour.
*   **Format:** METARs are written in a standard international format. You must learn how to decode them.

### TAF

*   **Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF):** A forecast of weather conditions at an airport, typically for a 24-hour period.
*   **Format:** TAFs are also written in a standard format that you must learn to decode.

*We will add a detailed guide on how to decode METARs and TAFs, with examples, later.*
