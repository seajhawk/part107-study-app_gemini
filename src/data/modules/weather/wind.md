# Wind and Currents

Wind is a major factor in drone operations.

### Wind

*   **Surface Wind:** The wind near the surface of the Earth.
*   **Wind Shear:** A sudden, drastic change in wind speed and/or direction over a very small area.

### Currents

*   **Convective Currents:** Upward and downward drafts of air caused by the heating of the Earth's surface.
*   **Mechanical Turbulence:** Turbulence created by the wind flowing over and around obstacles.
